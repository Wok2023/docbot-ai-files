At STADIO, you will be expected to compile and submit various documents for tuition
and assessment purposes. The work you submit may be in the form of study materials,
assignments, reports, dissertations, proposals, essays and projects. In preparing for
and compiling these documents, you will be expected to consult, read, review,
analyse, debate and paraphrase information from a wide variety of sources, including
books, journals, research reports, magazines, websites, eDocuments, eJournals,
eBooks, CDs, DVDs, films, conference proceedings, newspapers, brochures, white
papers, green papers, Government Gazettes, policies and Acts.
Each time you refer to an idea, concept, theory, model or explanation from an
information source, you need to identify and acknowledge the source − both in the
text of your document and in a reference list at the end of your document. The practice
of acknowledging sources (whether it is an author, editor, compiler, composer,
director or organisation) is known as referencing.
It is extremely important that you cite information sources accurately whenever you
refer to or use someone else’s ideas, opinions, theories, research, data, etc. Kotze
(2009:19) argues that a reference is required whenever you:
•
quote (use someone else’s exact words).
copy (use figures, tables or structure).
paraphrase (convert someone else’s ideas into your own words).
summarise (use a brief account of someone else’s ideas).
adapt (make minor revisions or remodel someone else’s ideas, models,
theories, illustrations, etc.).
WHY SHOULD YOU REFERENCE?
According to Harris (2000:23), references assist the author to:
acknowledge all the sources of information accessed.
substantiate arguments and discourse within the text.
avoid plagiarism, even when it is unintentional.
enable the reader(s) to follow up the source material.
show the scope and depth of the research.
5
strengthen the academic argument in the text.
show the reader the source of their information.
enable the reader to consult their sources independently.
enable the reader to verify the information/data provided in the text.
OF IT?
In the academic context, we are continually engaging with other people’s ideas. We
read them in texts, hear them in lectures, discuss them in class, and consequently,
often incorporate them into our own writing. As a result, it is very important that we
give credit where it is due by clearly signalling to the reader the precise sources from
which ideas and information have been taken.
Whenever you produce written work, such as assignments or answers to exam
questions, you must differentiate between your own ideas and those of others. You
must distinguish what you have written from what you are quoting directly or from
what you are referring to.
Using someone else’s ideas and not crediting those ideas properly (by referencing and
citing your sources) and thus presenting them as your own is plagiarism. Plagiarism
is cheating or academic fraud. Students found guilty of plagiarism will be punished.
Examples of plagiarism are:
Copying word for word (verbatim) from sections of a text (books, articles,
newspaper and magazine articles, study materials, etc.)
Using someone else’s work or ideas in a slightly altered form (such as
substituting words for others with a similar meaning or paraphrasing) without
acknowledgement
Copying from a classmate or from someone who completed the course before
you.
To prevent accusations of plagiarism, it is essential that you provide references
whenever you quote (use the exact words), paraphrase (use the ideas of another
person, in your own words) or summarise (use the main points of another’s opinions,
theories or data) from a source or text.
The Declaration of Authenticity that appears on the assignment cover sheet must be
signed. Subsequently, you cannot plead ignorance; by signing the declaration, you
admit that you have read and understood the nature of plagiarism and that your work
does not contain any plagiarised content. Should you fail to sign this declaration, your
assignment will not be marked.
It does not matter how much of the other person’s or institution’s work you use
(whether it is one sentence or a whole section), or whether you do it unintentionally
or on purpose. If you present the work as your own without acknowledging that
person/institution, you are committing plagiarism − an act tantamount to theft. You
are taking someone else’s work and passing it off as your own. Because of this,
plagiarism is regarded as a very serious offence and carries heavy penalties.
STADIO owns the copyright on all its academic material. This means that whoever
wishes to use STADIO material for assignments may do so, as long as they have
properly referenced the material used. This is true even if parts of the material are
used in the answer to an assignment question. Failure to do this is seen as plagiarism
and the student may either lose marks for the sections(s) copied or face disciplinary
action.
You must give acknowledgement whenever you use:
another person’s or institution’s ideas, opinions or theories.
any facts, statistics, graphs, drawings − any pieces of information that are
not common knowledge and that have been published. This applies to
magazine and newspaper articles, as well as to all academic publications.
quotations of someone’s actual spoken or written words or paraphrases of
another person’s/institution’s spoken or written words.
To avoid plagiarism:
Use quotation marks for everything that comes directly from the text (please
do not exceed 175 words in total for the entire quote when you quote).
Paraphrase, but be sure you are not just re-arranging or replacing a few
words. Instead, read over what you want to paraphrase carefully, cover up
the text with your hand, or close the text so you cannot see any of it. Write
out the idea in your own words without peeping, and cite the source you have
8
used in brackets after you have completed the idea. Check your paraphrasing
against the original text to be sure you have not accidentally used the same
phrases or words, and that the information is accurate (see also section 4.4).
Use your own words, whether you have worked in a group or not. Never use
a colleague/friend/family member’s assignment and merely paraphrase a
number of words. It is never acceptable for students to share one electronic
copy of the answers and to make minor changes before hand-in. Also, never
share your assignment with anyone prior to hand-in date − you will notice
that you are required to confirm on the Declaration of Authenticity that you
have not made your assignment available to anyone else.
The content in STADIO study guides and teaching documents is not intended to be
sold for commercial purposes. Such content is in essence part of tuition and
constitutes an integral part of the learning experience.
COPYRIGHT/PLAGIARISM
When authors/students/academics submit work1, the same copyright/ plagiarism rules
apply. No amount of any type of content should be used without reference in a way
that is in line with accepted rules for academic work and as referred to in authoring
contracts.
The following are guidelines:
a)
A direct quote from another author’s work may not exceed 175 words for the
total quote, should be in quotation marks and should be referenced properly.
b)
No amount of plain text may be copied from another publication other than
for referenced quotes as mentioned above.
c)
Authors can represent a diagram from another author with a reference. Such
a diagram should form an integral part of the academic argument provided to
the students. If such a diagram is changed in any way for the purposes of
representation, the original author should be acknowledged and referenced.
d)
Any presentation of photos and artwork can only be done with the permission
of the photographer or the original artist. LISOF students may use images for
assessments, provided they reference the author accordingly.
e)
As part of learning activities, links can be provided to free video clips in the
public domain to follow and watch as further enrichment, and as part of
exploration beyond the basic learning content.
f)
As part of activities, links can also be provided for the above purpose to
external websites for further enrichment and as part of exploration beyond
the basic learning content. However, content of such websites is protected by
1  When we say ‘work’, it could refer to anyone's ideas such as words, images, audio, videos, designs textbooks,
Internet web pages, newspapers, magazines, photographs, illustrations, diagrams and many more.
the same rules as for printed text and may not be used without a reference
and/or permission.
g)
Practices such as in-linking or deep-linking (linking into a particular website
towards a specific target, or links that import images and other pieces of
content directly) are not allowed.
All STADIO teaching materials and academic content are scanned by an approved and
appropriate similarity detection programme such as Turnitin. These programmes are
widely used to alert researchers, students and institutions such as STADIO to
problems in texts related to plagiarism and copyright. Texts found to contain problems
will be referred back to authors and the necessary steps will be taken.
Authors are reminded of their contractual responsibilities in terms of submitting
original work, and the obligation to reference, acknowledge and respect the work of
other authors. It is a contractual responsibility of an author to follow accepted
copyright rules and not to commit plagiarism.
There are four forms of plagiarism:
The work submitted or presented has been done by someone other than the
person submitting the work.
When the whole work, such as an essay, is copied from some other source.
When parts of the work are taken from another source and no reference is
made to the original author.
When a student submits or presents work in one course which has also been
submitted in another course, and has not sought approval from the course
coordinator to do so.
In summary, plagiarism refers to any or all of the following:
To steal and pass off the ideas or words of another as one's own
To use another's production (written or media) without crediting the source
To commit literary theft (stealing the writing of someone else and presenting
it as your own)
To present an idea or product as new and original while deriving it from an
existing source
Turning in someone else's work as your own
11
Copying words or ideas from someone else without giving credit
Failing to put a quotation in quotation marks
Giving incorrect information about the source of a quotation
Providing a false (non-existent) source
Changing words, but copying the sentence structure of a source without giving
credit (not properly paraphrasing)
Copying so many words or ideas from a source that it makes up the majority
of your work, whether you give credit or not.
You must provide a reference whenever you quote, paraphrase or summarise
someone else’s ideas, models, theories or data. You must also reference any graphic
information (such as graphs, pictographs, tables, illustrations, etc.) that you use.
Some of the sources you will need to reference include the following:
Books or chapters in books
Journal or newspaper articles
Conference papers
Films or television programmes
Personal communications, such as emails, interviews or letters
Electronic sources, such as web pages, journal articles from online databases,
or electronic discussion forums, etc.
Kotze (2009) points out that references should be used whenever you:
quote the exact words of another author.
refer to, paraphrase or summarise someone else’s ideas, theories, arguments
and/or research in your own words.
present another author’s interpretation, point of view, opinion or
understanding about an issue in your own words.
state specific factual information, such as statistics, graphs, facts, verbal
interviews.
present diary entries that you have obtained from someone/somewhere else.
present a table, graph, figure or diagram taken or adapted from another
source.
construct a table, graph, figure or diagram from data or information taken
from another source (i.e. a source other than data that you have collected
yourself).
WHICH REFERENCING SYSTEM SHOULD YOU USE?
There are different referencing systems used in academic writing. STADIO uses an
adapted version of the author–date system, commonly known as the Harvard
Referencing System. This adaptation is called the STADIO Referencing System.
The author–date referencing system comprises two parts, namely:
The author and the date are referred to in the text or main body of your writing
(called embedded or in-text referencing).
All the resources referred to in the body of writing are included in the
Reference List at the end of the text/assignment. All information is included
in this list: author, date, title of publication, publisher and where it was
published.
The other features of author–date referencing include:
a specific order in which the information should be structured.
the in-text reference, which should be placed (cited) in such a way that it
causes minimal disruption to the flow of your writing. This usually means that
the in-text referencing will appear at the very end or the very beginning of
your sentences (see ways of citing below).
When you cite sources of information in the text, regardless of whether you quote,
copy, paraphrase or summarise, you should include:
the author’s surname (family name).
the year of publication (latest edition).
page numbers, when directly quoting or closely paraphrasing an author’s
words/material.
correct punctuation and spacing.
You are therefore advised to adhere strictly to the referencing conventions as
explained in this guide.
METHODS OF ‘IN-TEXT REFERENCING’ OR CITATION
The STADIO Referencing System acknowledges the following methods of citing
references, namely:
author-prominent citations
information-prominent citations
image referencing (caption method)
image referencing (thumbnail method)
referencing edited or original images or photographs.
Author-prominent citation
This approach/style gives prominence to the author by using the author’s surname
(family name) with the date, followed by a colon and the page number in parentheses
(round brackets).
Examples
Direct quote:
Govender (1999:31) argues that “school teachers in South Africa confuse the term
technology as being solely concerned with computers, machines and gadgets”.
“Design is notoriously complex to define ... It improves existing conditions in various
levels of society” (Aspelund, 2010:22).
Design is important because “[i]t improves existing conditions” (Aspelund, 2010:22).
Design has the potential to fix problematic conditions in “various levels of society”
(Aspelund, 2010:22).
Paraphrase (see also section 4.4):
Govender (1999) suggests that South African schoolteachers have an ill-conceived
perception that technology refers mainly to machines and gadgets.
According to Aspelund (2010:22), designing can improve existing conditions.
15
Please note
If the author is an “institution, organisation or non-human”, the in-text reference
should be at the end of the sentence or quotation, for example:
“Technology education is a largely unexplored concept in South Africa” (UN Report,
2007:29),
and not
According to the UN Report (2007:29), “Technology education is a largely unexplored
concept in South Africa.”
Information-prominent citation
This method of citing references gives prominence to the information, with all the
required referencing details in parentheses at the end of the citation.
It has been argued that “school teachers in South Africa confuse the term technology
as being solely concerned with computers, machines and gadgets” (Govender,
1999:31).
South African schoolteachers have an ill-conceived perception that technology refers
mainly to machines and gadgets (Govender, 1999:31).

Image referencing (caption method)
STADIO School of Fashion uses the caption method for modules, including marketing,
consumer behaviour, retail management, entrepreneurship and business, for theory
assessments such as:
reports
analyses
rationales.
Caption method requires:
Caption underneath the image providing a figure number, in-text citation
(same as in-text referencing rules). Location, if available.
Matching reference entry in a separate image reference list at the end of your
assessment. Remember to provide all necessary information.
Example
The image to the left was sourced from cosmopolitan.com.
Although Emma Baty wrote the article, this image has been
used with permission (and payment) from a photographer.
On the website, a caption underneath the image credits the
photographer, Dan MacMedan. The photographer is therefore
the author of the image, not Emma Baty.

Image referencing (thumbnail method)
Used for practical or visually-oriented modules, including creative design, visual
merchandising, trend analysis and computer literacy, for practical assessments such
as:
mood, trend or design boards
presentations
visual analysis.
In practical assessments, you must compile a visually appealing presentation filled
with images for various purposes, such as a PowerPoint, mood board or look board
presentation. In this case, adding many captions would look ugly and distract the
viewer from the purpose of the board − to present visual information.
The thumbnail method requires you to compile a separate visual reference list using
a smaller ‘thumbnail’ version of the image next to the reference list entry. This allows
your marker to verify image sources without the use of captions.

If a source has three or more authors, the surnames of all the authors must be listed
in the first in-text reference to the specific source. Thereafter, only the surname of
the first author is shown in all in-text references. The surnames of the second and
later authors are replaced with the abbreviation et al. Since et al. is an abbreviation
for the Latin words et alii, it must always be typed in italics with a full stop at the end.
This principle applies to all source types, for example:
First time in use: Govender, Mhkize and Whithall (2009) argue that…
Thereafter in the document: Govender et al. (2009) dispute the fact that…
If a source has multiple (two or more) authors, the ampersand sign (&) may be used
in place of the word ‘and’ where authors are listed in in-text citations that appear in
brackets, as well as in the list of references. However, the ampersand sign (&) may
not be used when the authors are listed as part of a normal sentence.
Examples:
Geczy and Karaminas (2017:9) state that Westwood’s influence on design broke down
the historically strong relationship between fashion and wealth.

between fashion and wealth (Geczy & Karaminas, 2017:9).

Paraphrasing means to restate something you have read, accurately and succinctly,
in your own words. If your work does not refer to specific ideas on particular pages of
a resource, but to general themes mentioned throughout the resource, page numbers
need not be shown.
Example
General theme
Meta analytical studies (Rob, 2009) reveal that South Africa cannot be classified as a
developed country.
Specific idea
Rob (2009:28) claims that the economic structure of South Africa does not entitle it
to be classified as a developed country for now.
When to paraphrase or use quotations
It is preferable that you paraphrase (put ideas in your own words), as too many
quotations (using the exact words) can lead to a poorly written assignment. A general
rule in academic practice is that no more than 10% of an assignment should be in the
form of direct quotations. No matter whether you use quotations or paraphrase
another’s words, you always need to give references, both in the text and in the
reference list.
Quotations should be used sparingly, selected carefully, used in context, integrated
into your text and reproduced exactly (including the words, spelling, punctuation,
capitalisation and paragraphing of the original writer). The original author’s exact
words, including any spelling or grammatical errors, should be quoted. Kotze (2009:6)
21
advises us that if the original wording contains spelling or grammatical errors, one has
to point these errors out by placing the word [sic] in square brackets in the quote
directly after the error. The word [sic] (meaning so or thus) can be inserted in a
quotation when the original text is incorrect with regard to grammar, spelling or
gender.
According to Aswy (2006:21), the DCLD is a “centre of excellence at Unisa and this
con [sic] be attributed to the dedication of the education consultants employed at the
DCLD”. (NB: the word ‘con’ is misspelt. [sic] has been added to denote this.)
Babes (2005:21) argues that “when human beings interact with animals, he [sic]
should be aware of their sensitivity to rough play”. (‘He’ is not gender sensitive, and
therefore, the author should have stated [they].)
Short quotations
Short quotations (fewer than 30 words) should:
be incorporated into your sentence without disrupting the flow of your
paragraph.
have double quotation marks.
maintain the same font size.
Incorporating a quote as part of your sentence — information prominent
The reference comes AFTER the quotation, UNLESS you referred to the author before
the quote: The church is not the only setting where the soul may be nurtured, as
“[t]he soul also finds sustenance in more domestic settings, like the family home
where customs and values have created a spirit handed down over generations”
(Jonas 1998:9).
Incorporating a quote as part of your sentence — author prominent
The church is not the only setting where the soul may be nurtured. As Jonas (1998:9)
suggests, “[t]he soul also finds sustenance in more domestic settings, like the family
home where customs and values have created a spirit handed down over generations”.
The square brackets around the ‘t’ – [t] – are used to indicate that in the original
quotation, the word ‘the’ began with a capital ‘T’.
22
Long quotations
Long quotations (more than 30 words) should:
be introduced in your own words.
begin on a new line.
be fully indented by default (i.e. 1.27 cm) from both margins.
be in reduced line spacing compared to the rest of the text.
use a smaller font for the quotation (that is, change from size 10.5 to size
10).
Separate the quotation from the lead-in statement with one blank line. The lead-in
statement ends with a colon (:). Separate the quotation from the text that follows it
with one blank line. This is illustrated below.
Friere (1998:3) summarises the effects of reducing literacy to a set of tools or skills
when he states that:
[m]erely teaching men [sic] to read and write does not work miracles: if there are
not enough jobs for men [sic] able to work, teaching more men [sic] to read and
write will not create them. When literacy is considered as a social practice, the
relationships that exist between language use and the production and
maintenance of cultural and ideological hegemony are uncovered.
Quotation marks are not used for longer quotations. When using an information-
prominent long quotation, the full stop will be included after the last sentence of the
quotation before the citation, as shown below.
The church is not the only setting where the soul may be nurtured as:
[t]he soul also finds sustenance in more domestic settings, like the family home,
where customs and values have created a spirit handed  down over generations.
According to Thomas Moore, the soul finds sacredness in the ordinary, and may
benefit most when its spiritual life is performed in the context of mundane daily
life. (Jones, 1998:89)
Words omitted from quotations
23
To omit words from quotations, use an ellipsis. An ellipsis consists of three full stops
(…). Do not leave any spaces before the ellipsis or after the ellipsis. If you contemplate
omitting parts of the quotation, make certain that the omission(s) do not alter the
meaning of the sentence/quotation.
Wells (1991:7) describes literacy as a “set of practices which people use in literacy
events…and that literacy practices are situated in social relations”.
Hint: if the quotation does not begin at the start of a sentence, an ellipsis should be
used to convey this to the reader.
Students may adopt a more dominant understanding of literacy because of the
emphasis they place on literacy as a means of achieving “…equality of opportunity and
the possibilities of liberty and democracy” (Rock, 1994:213).
Double quotations
For a double quotation, i.e. a quotation within a quotation, use single quotation marks
inside double quotation marks.
“The first words of Melville’s Moby Dick are ‘Call me Ishmael’ and these words are full
of significance” was the first statement in Smith’s memorable speech (Johns,
1995:43).
The square brackets in quotations
Sometimes in quotations, it is necessary to insert a word that explains the meaning
of another word in that quotation. Place the explanation in square brackets.
“The curriculum of the national schools in the 1870s included reading, writing,
arithmetic, drill [physical exercises] and music” (Cavey, 1996:21).
You may come across some information sources where no date/year of publication is
given. If no year is given for a source, use n.d. (which stands for ‘not dated’) after the
author's name.
In-text referencing example: in a detailed analysis, Jackie (n.d.) argues…
Reference list example: Jackie, C. Not dated. The year that was. New York:
Caxton.
Hint: this rule should be followed for all sources of information (i.e. you should indicate
‘Not dated’ in the reference list for the year of publication).
In place of publication, simply state ‘Not known’:
Dick, K. 2001. The ride to hell. Not known: Caxton.
When the publisher is unknown, simply state ‘Not known’:
Dick, K. 2001. The ride to hell. London: Not known.
Page numbers should be used when you quote directly from material (word for word)
from the original publication. This includes tables or figures. Page numbers should also

be provided for indirect quotes and paraphrasing where the summarised material
appears on specific pages, in specific chapters or in specific sections.
One page referred to: Wells (1992:4)

Page numbers are not indicated
You may come across sources of information where page numbers have been omitted.
Kotze (2009:33) states that “If an original document (except a web page) does not
have page numbers, one should still indicate to the reader on what page the
information can be found”. He advises that this could be done by counting the pages
from the front and then including that number in an in-text reference, indicating that
the original pages were not numbered by placing the page count in square brackets.
Dick (2000:[19]) states that biodiversity cannot be accommodated in the 21st century

The title should be ‘References’ and it should be as follows:
Bold

In the same font size as the document, 10.5 pt.
Not underlined.
The references contained in the list should:
be in single line spacing.
use a line spacing of 10.5 pt. after each reference.
be left aligned.
be arranged alphabetically.
be the final page of your assignment. (Appendices/annexures are placed after
the reference list.)
The reference list should contain all the sources cited in the paper and no sources that
are not cited.
A source is listed only once in the reference list, regardless of how many times it is
cited in-text.
Evaluating websites for educational use
Always be vigilant when extracting information from any electronic source. The
standard of reliability and validity for information on websites is often not as high as
for articles in published materials. Anyone can place information on the internet, often
without any review process. Facts and figures on websites are sometimes misleading
and therefore every effort should be made to choose websites very carefully.
Reliable sources generally include:
referenced articles in online journals.
articles from databases selected by the university.
articles published by universities.
27
reports and white papers published by government departments, business
organisations and reputable lobby groups.
Consider the following:
The purpose of the website (to inform, to persuade, to sell). If you know the
motive behind the web page, you can make an informed decision about
whether it is suitable for your assessment.
Is there an author/sponsor? If you cannot find an author or an organisation
responsible for publishing the site, then it is most likely unreliable.
Is the author qualified to write about this topic? What is the author’s
expertise? Is the sponsor reputable? Are opinions being presented as facts?
Try to differentiate fact from fiction. Authenticity is not always easy to confirm,
so test one source against another. Make sure there is no bias evident.
Ascertain whether the person presenting the information has a vested interest
in proposing the particular view point.
Are references or bibliographies included?
How current is the information?
When was the website last updated?
Is the information well written and free of grammatical errors?
Note
It is accepted that some of the electronic information which you use may not be
retrievable as it is either being updated/amended or has been deleted. To guard
against this possibility, print the material you are referring to, or save it to a CD, DVD,
a memory stick or in the cloud so that you have a permanent record.
Guidelines on citations and compiling
reference lists
In-text referencing

strategy as...
Information prominent:
Strategy is an elusive
concept to define (Booth,
2001:23).
Booth, J. 2001. Strategic
interventions in leadership. 9th ed.
London: McMillan.
Hint: the title page verso (i.e. the
page following directly after the
title page) usually contains
information on the date of
publication, edition, place of
publication and publisher of a
book.
The date of publication of a book is
usually indicated on the title page
verso directly after the copyright
sign (©).
Use normal sentence case for the
title of the book. This means that
only the first word of the title and
all proper nouns are capitalised. All
the other words in the title are
written in small letters.
The title of the book must be
printed in italics.
Where spaces are included in in-
text references (e.g. after the
comma and before the date) or in
29
entries in the list of references,
these are always single spaces.
There is a single space after the
colon and before the name of the
publisher.
Note the full stop at the end of
each entry in the list of references.
Omit words such as Publishers,
Co., Inc., (Pty) Ltd., & Sons that
are not necessary to identify a
If the place of publication is not
well known, include the town/city,
province and/or country.
Two single
authors with
the same
surname
When referring to two
authors with the same
surname, publishing in the
same year, the initials
must be used in the text
to distinguish between the
two.

Hint: note that the word
‘and’ is used in full
sentences, while the
ampersand sign (&) is
used in in-text citations
that appear in brackets, as
well as in the list of
references. This principle
applies to all source types.
Three or more
authors

but use ‘and’ in author-

Note: the abbreviation et

full stop at the end)
indicates that a source has
three or more authors.
Meden, J., Tedd, J. & Moller, P.

For example, when
referring to information
taken from the chapter by

an in-text reference, you
would cite Smith
(1996:23) in the in-text
reference and not the

Electronic/
online
journals
Online journals can
appear in two formats,
namely:
• .html
• .pdf
When an electronic
journal article is printed
or viewed in .html format,
the number of pages will
differ depending on the
printer, page set-up and
font size used when the
article is printed. As a
result, page numbers are
not mentioned in in-text
citations. However articles
viewed in .pdf format
have fixed page numbers
and font sizes, therefore
we can refer to the exact

American Educational Research
Association Stable:
http://www.jstor.org/stable/3594377
[Accessed: 19.02.2009]
Hint: the page indication of 40 (22p)
indicates that the article started on
p. 40 of the original paper-based
journal and that it was 22 pages long
when printed from the internet. This
page indication also alerts the reader
to the fact that the article was viewed
in .html format.

Hint: if you quote from a
journal article in .html
format, there is no need
to provide page numbers
in brackets after the
author’s surname, even if
it is a direct quote.
Example:
Jane (2005) argues that
“Gas is a cheaper
alternative to power in

There are three options that you
can employ when referencing a
newspaper article of which the
author is unknown:
Use the term ‘Anon.’ in the place of
the author.
Example:
According to Anon. (2009)...
Use the name of the newspaper in
place of the author.

Star, 2009:16).
Use the title of the article in place
of the author.

(Who’s fooling who? 2009:16).
Hint: never begin a sentence with
the title of the newspaper or the
title of the article when in the
author-prominent mode.
According to The Star (2009:16)...

Where there are several
works by one author and
they are published in the
same year, they should be
differentiated by adding a
lower-case letter after the
date.
Remember that this must
also be consistent with the
citations in the text. For
multiple works, the required
elements for a reference are:
Author. Year. Title of book.
Place of publication:
Publisher.
Example:

argument that...

submitted as an appendix in an academic
submission.
Obtain permission from the email sender/ recipient

Reference List
Kotze (2009:29–30) states
that web pages refer to any
information (other than
articles from web-based
electronic journal platforms
or web-based electronic
journals) that is published on
the World Wide Web. He
goes on to add that one can
distinguish between web
pages (in .htm, .html, .xml &
.asp format) and files that
can be downloaded from the
web (in .doc and .pdf
format). The basic in-text
structure of a reference to
information on the World
Wide Web is as follows:
Author’s Surname (date
written)
Note:
The date should appear after
the author’s surname.
If the name of the author is
not available, please use the
name of the organisation
associated with the website.
Author’s Surname, Initials. Year. Title of article or

Hint: in some cases, websites continuously change
and it is therefore advisable to print and file a

Q.
How do I cite and reference sources in languages other than English?
A.
Use the language of the information source.
Q.
Which letters should I capitalise?
Capitalise:
the first letter of each author's surname and each initial.
the first letter of the publication title written in italics.
all the first letters of the main words in the title of a journal,
newspaper.
all the first letters of a place name.
all the first letters of a publisher.
What if there is no example in this guide for the source that I am using?
Begin by applying the guidelines for books and then exchange or add in
guidelines from other types of information sources in order to build the entry.
You will also find ample examples on the Internet, but remember to adapt
them to the style and format used in the guide.
Where do I find the date of a work?
Finding a publication date is not always easy. In books, it would be with the
other publication information on the title page or verso page.
The publication date of printed journals and newspapers is on the cover or, in
the case of periodicals, the spine and back page or around the table of
contents.
In the case of websites and blog posts, the publication date can be somewhere
around the title or in the footer of the page.
What if a book has more than one date?
Use the latest publication (edition) date for citation purposes. Be sure not to
take the latest reprint date, which may be more recent. A reprint is not a new
edition; a reprint simply means that more books of that edition were printed
at a later date.
What if the date is in Roman letters?
Convert the letters to numbers (Arabic numerals), e.g. MCMLXXXV = 1985.
What if there is no date?
A.
Use the abbreviation n.d. (which stands for "no date") in the second position.
How do I cite two sources written by the same author in the same year?
Add lower case letters after the date.
(Molefe, 2001a:23; Molefe, 2001b:104)
How do I cite a number of different sources to support the same point?
Cite them in alphabetical order and separate the different citations with a
semicolon.
(Epstein et al., 2012:278; Hudson & Nurius, 1994:103; Rosen, 1996:324)
What if I have more than one work by the same author; how do I list them in
the reference list?
List them in the order of the date, starting with the earliest first.
Molefe, T. 2001a. …
Molefe, T. 2001b. …
Molefe, T. 2004. …
Which place of publication should I include in the reference if a book lists more
than one place?
Include only the first place name listed in the book.
Which publisher should I include in my reference if a book lists multiple
publishers?
Include only the first publisher listed.
Do I have to include the publisher’s name in full?
Provide the name of the publisher in the shortest possible form that will be
recognised internationally, e.g. "Sage" and not "Sage Publications", and "Van
Schaik" and not "JL van Schaik".
Some Harvard referencing style manuals use the words "Available at" or
"Available from" before the URL of an electronic publication. What is the
correct way?
It used to be the preferred way but lately most style manuals omit those
words since the URL sufficiently indicates the location of the source. The
STADIO style does not require this phrase.
Some online journal articles and webpages have very long URLs.
Very long URLs may be shortened to the first forward slash /.
Why do I have to include the date when I access a website?
67
Website pages appear and disappear so often that it is vital to indicate that
the information was accurate at the date given.
Which do I choose: the website URL or the DOI?
The DOI (digital object identifier) is a unique identifier that is assigned to
some website pages. When it is present, use it instead of the website URL and
date accessed.
Can I use software to manage the reference list?
You can make use of reference managers, of which some are freely available
on the Internet, i.e. Cite This For Me at http://www.citethisforme.com/ or
Mendeley at https://www.mendeley.com/search/. However, you may find it
necessary to adapt the references created by a reference manager to the style
and format of this guide.
If a source has more than one format, for example a printed and an online
format, which information do I use in the reference list?
Only use the information of the format that you have used in your research.
If you have used a printed format, use that information in the reference list.
When do I use pp. and when do I only show the page number range?
When there is information about the series, volume and/or issue number, the
page or page range numbers follow immediately after a colon (:).

Reference style of the Tydskrif vir Hedendaagse Romeins-Hollandse Reg (THRHR) /
Journal of Contemporary Roman-Dutch Law
The THRHR reference style is used for in-text and footnote referencing
Documents should be typed in double spacing on one side of A4 size paper. This
applies to summaries, footnotes and quotations.
Abbreviations are not used in the text; in footnotes (and bracketed references)
recognised abbreviations are used extensively. Punctuation and spaces are not used
in abbreviations: eg, cf, USA, THRHR, RSA, BA, LLM, Unisa, SALJ.
Examples
s for section (plural ss); ff for and further; para for paragraph (plural paras); 2ed for
second edition; AJ for Acting Judge; J for Judge; JA for Judge of Appeal; JP for Judge
President, AJA for Acting Judge of Appeal; CJ for Chief Justice; reg for regulation; ch
for chapter; and cf for compare.
Quotations correspond exactly with the original, that is, with italicisation, capital
letters, full stops, etcetera, unchanged. All changes or insertions in quotations are
made in square brackets, for example: “[I]n…”.
Use double quotation marks (with single quotation marks inside a quotation). Where
a full sentence is quoted, the quotation marks are placed after the full stop. In other
cases, quotations marks are place before the comma, colon or semi-colon.
The use of capital letters should be limited as far as possible. All footnotes start with
a capital letter.
Consult the examples (provided by lecturers).
Quotations (also in Latin) are NOT italicised. Words and expressions in a language
other than that of the document are in italics, for example: dolus, fait accompli,
Grundnorm.
Cases
The names of the parties and the “v” between them are in italics. The words “and
another”, “and others”, etcetera are omitted. Example: Botha v Botha 1979 3 SA 792
(T).
Subsequent reference to the same case: Botha v Botha.
It is unnecessary to supply the initials of the author (except where the omission may
cause confusion). Book titles are in italics. Only the first word of the title starts with a
capital letter, except where proper names appear in the title. The date of publication
is provided between brackets. Example of a book reference: Sharrock Business
transactions law 9ed (2016). Subsequent references to the same book: Sharrock 30.

Articles
The titles of articles are place in quotation marks. Only the first word of the title starts
with a capital letter. Names of journals are in italics and not abbreviated (except LJ,
LR and Univ): Harvard LR, Yale LR, De Rebus, De Jure. But THRHR, SALJ, TSAR, CILSA,
SASK, SA Merc LJ, LQR, JRS. The volume number is omitted (except where the page
numbers of a journal are not continuous – such as Codicillus and De Rebus. Example
of an article reference: Koziol “Incorrect advice to investors and the liability of banks”
2011 THRHR 1.
Subsequent reference to the same article: Kozio 2011 THRHR 5.
Legislation
The title and number of an Act are not italicised: Bills of Exchange Act 34 of 1964.
References to legislation in the text may also be informal (as soon as it is clear to the
reader which Act is referred to): The Act/The 1926 Act.
Old authorities
See 1985 THRHR 125.
