THE NATURE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT5.1Sexual harassment or abuse may take many forms and may be subtle and indirect, or blatant and overt. The seriousness of an act of sexual harassment may vary and it may, amongst others, consist of any or all of the following:(i)It may be conducted towards an individual of the opposite sex or the same sex.(ii)It may occur between peers or between individuals in a hierarchical relationship.(iii)It may be aimed at coercing an individual to participate in an unwanted sexual relationship.(iv)It may consist of repeated actions or may even arise from a single incident.(v)It may include insults or sexual advances historically acceptable in certain cultures.
5 EXAMPLES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT may include, amongst others:(i)Sexual advances(ii)Requests for sexual favours in return for study benefits(iii)Verbal abuse with sexual overtones(iv)Innuendos, including remarks about a person’s appearance, body or clothing(v)Physical contact(vi)Obscene gestures or indecent exposure(vii)Staring, leering and whistling(viii)Display of sexually offensive or explicit material, including posters, magazines, pictures or objects(ix)Direct sexual propositions(x)Continued pressure for dates and sexual favours(xi)Letters or calls of a sexual nature(xii)Any ofthe above as a form of coercion or blackmail for advancement or for lack of advancement or dismissal if the recipient refuses.(xiii)Any other unwelcome form of physical or verbal behaviour that has sexual overtones (dirty jokes are not necessarily viewed as sexual harassment except if aimed at an individual with the intention of causing embarrassment or offence).5.2It is not a requirement that the victim of sexual harassment must immediately make known his or her disapproval of what is being said, done or suggested.  5.3Where the victim fails to immediately make known his or her feeling, she or he will be required to furnish clear reasons for his/her failure to express immediate disapproval including but not limited to:(a)fear of victimisation, or(b)the person being harassed feels threatened, should he/she express his/her disapproval, or(c)any other justified reasons preventing him/her from expressing his/her disapproval.5.4The severity of the harassment is determined largely by the psychological effect it has on the victim (in other words, it is a subjective assessment), and not by the intention of the person who performed the act of harassment.
6 5.5The severity will depend on the circumstances and nature of the offence: however, even a single serious act of sexual harassment may lead to a sanction of suspension of the perpetrator from the Institution.6.
REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT6.1Any student who feels that she/he has been harassed must bring the complaint to the attention of the Institutional Registrar who, with the assistance of a panel of professional experts identified by the Institution, evaluates the evidence and the severity of the complaint and decides whether the matter may be resolved between parties or should be pursued inaccordance with the Student Disciplinary Code.6.2The Registrar must deal promptly with a complaint of sexual harassment and ensure that as soon as reasonably possible, steps are taken to stop the harassment, prevent its recurrence and take appropriate action against the perpetrator.6.3The confidentiality and privacy of any individual who reports or is accused of sexual harassment must be respected.6.4STADIO, through the Office of the Registrar, will make available professional advice and counselling for victims of sexual harassment.6.5STADIOwill not countenance any form of victimisation resulting from the lodging of a complaint, regardless of whether sexual harassment is subsequently proven, and any person proved to have victimised another for lodging a claim of sexual harassment will be subjected to disciplinary proceedings.6.6Disciplinary action will be taken against any person proven to have made a false accusation of sexual harassment. A person who falsely accuses another may be required to publicly clear the name of the person against whom the false complaint was laid.

PROCEDURE FOR DEALING WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONSThe following procedures are possible for dealing with sexual harassment: an informal procedure and, failing a satisfactory solution, a formal procedure. Criminal and civil charges may also be laid.7.1Informal procedure7.1.1The informal procedure involves discussion and/or conciliation after the matter has been brought to the attention of the Office of the Registrar and includes the assistance and support of a panel of professional experts. 7.1.2If the complaint cannot be resolved to the complainant’s satisfaction and it is found through discussion that the incident warrants more serious action, formal disciplinary procedures will be instituted against the alleged offender.7.2Formal procedureIf the discussions/conciliation cannot resolve the issue, the complaint will be dealt with in accordance with the Student Disciplinary Code.7.3Criminal or civil charges7.3.1Particularly in the case of physical abuse, the above procedures do not override theright of a student or any other person to lay criminal or civil charges against the person involved, without consulting STADIO. 7.3.2Cases of assault and rape are criminal activities and will always be referred to the South African Police Service by STADIO. 7.3.3Nothing contained in this Policy precludes a victim from taking the matter to a criminal or a civil court, or a Chapter 9 Institution established under the law of the South African Constitution.
