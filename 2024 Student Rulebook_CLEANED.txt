Dear Student
Thank you for taking the time to open this document and actually start reading.  Please don’t stop now —
read to the end because I have something important and provocative to share.
How do you regard the notion of ‘rules’?
Many reactions are immediately negative (something like “I hate people telling me what to do!”), but that’s the
common mistake. Rules give effect to the critical values of accountability, transparency, fairness, and
responsibility for both you and STADIO, ensuring that we have a shared understanding of our rights and
responsibilities, the expectations, and the regulatory and policy parameters undergirding your student journey
with STADIO.
At STADIO we are committed to encouraging the holistic development of our students.  Understanding and
applying the principles of key concepts such as a social compact, equality, and accountability are critical to
your success both as a student and as you prepare for entry into the exciting world of work.
So, starting from a better premise, namely, that norms and standards (‘rules’) generally, and specifically as set
out in this Rule Book, will have a positive impact in guiding your relationship and engagement with STADIO,
I invite you to familiarise yourself with the content and always know where to find it in case of need.
There’s an important legal principle: ignorance of the law is no excuse. That’s right, you cannot argue that ‘you
didn’t know’ in order to defend yourself. Be well-informed — after all, ‘knowledge is power’ (Sir Francis
Bacon).
Good luck with your student journey at STADIO; take advantage of every opportunity presented, and make
your dreams come true.
Dr Divya Singh
Chief Academic Officer
