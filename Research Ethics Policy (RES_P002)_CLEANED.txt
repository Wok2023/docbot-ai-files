5.
5.1
Researchers have the right to academic freedom.
5.2
Research ethics applications submitted to the Honours or Masters & Doctoral Working Groups must be
accompanied by the signature of the supervisor
5.3
It is the responsibility of the researcher to ensure that he or she does not undertake research without ethics
approval.
5.4
Researchers have a right and a duty to make all necessary efforts to bring the research and its findings or
results to the public domain in an appropriate manner using appropriate and acceptable forums and at an
appropriate time. The publishing of research findings should be done in a manner that will not harm
research participants or their communities.
5.5
Researchers may not commit plagiarism, piracy, falsification or the fabrication of results at any stage of
the research.
5.6
Researchers must acknowledge, declare and indicate how they will mitigate real or perceived conflicts of
interest.
7
5.7
Researchers may be required to report regularly to the relevant Research Ethics Working Group.
5.8
Any researcher who experiences unexpected adverse events or makes changes to the research procedures
that will increase the risks of harm to the participants should inform the relevant Research Ethics Working
Group.
5.9
In the event of a researcher contravening the Policy on Research Ethics, it will be investigated by the
relevant Research Ethics Working Group and the findings reported to the SREC for decision-making.
5.10
STADIO supports Open Access to science and research. Researchers should ensure the protection of the
interests of co-researchers and participants, including the participants' right to privacy and confidentiality,
when sharing data or making it public in any form.
5.11
The publishing of research findings should be done in a manner that will not harm research participants,
their communities and/or institutions.
5.12
Research results should be reported irrespective of whether they support or contradict the expected
outcome(s).
5.13
Researchers should ensure that the personal information of participants is only used for the agreed research
purposes with the participants and that it is adequately protected to prevent possible loss, damage and/or
unauthorized access as required by the Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013 (POPIA). They
should never expose such participants and institutions to procedures or risks not directly attached to the
research project or its methodology.
5.14
The Request for Information under the Promotion of Access to Information Act 2 of 2000 should be
followed if a research participant or researcher requests access to the records of personal information
processed by STADIO for research purposes.
5.15
Research and the pursuit of knowledge should not, in themselves, be regarded as
the supreme goal at the expense of the rights of participants and institutions.
5.16
Collaborative research involving human participants must not commence without ethics approval by the
Ethics Review Committee (ERC) of all collaborating institutions. This requirement may be waivered by the
SREC if the local host institution's REC is registered with the National Research Ethics Review Council or
the national host institution adheres to minimum research ethics standards comparative to those set out in
the STADIO Policy on Research Ethics.
8
5.17

Sharing personal information across borders to other researchers in other countries must meet the
requirements of transborder information flows of the Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013 to
uphold substantially similar lawful processing or consent conditions.
5.19
Autonomy requires that individuals' participation should be freely given, based on informed consent and for
a specific purpose, as required by the Personal Information Act 4 of 2013. Direct or indirect coercion, as
well as undue inducement of people in the name of research should be avoided.
5.20
The researcher should ensure that participants  give their consent in writing and preferably accompanied by
their signature. They, in turn, should be given written information containing adequate details of the
research, including any risks associated with the study. If participants choose not to provide their consent in
writing, consent may be recorded verbally, provided that verbal consent can be linked to the individual
providing such verbal consent. For example, where a participant is illiterate, consent should be obtained in
the presence of a literate witness who should verify and sign a document stating that informed consent had
been given. Where the research is done on-line or electronically, informed consent can be obtained
electronically on condition that reasonable steps are in place to protect the identity of the participant.
5.21
Researchers should treat research participants as unique human beings within the context of their
community systems and should respect what could be traditionally sacred and secret. Research should
preferably be undertaken with, the members of an identified community or communities rather than merely
about such community(ies). In some situations, the consent of "gatekeepers" may have to be obtained in
addition to that of research participants.
5.22
It is the responsibility of the primary researcher to ensure compliance with the research policy/directives of
gatekeepers or organizational structures.
5.23
Criteria for the selection of research participants should be fair, unbiased as well as being scientific. Easily
accessible individuals or groups should not be inordinately burdened with repeated demands on their time
and knowledge by the researcher.
5.24
Researchers should ensure that the actual benefits to be derived by the
participants, society or environment from the research clearly outweigh any possible risks, and that
participants, researchers and the environment are subjected only to those risks that are clearly necessary
for the conduct of the research. Researchers should ensure that these risks are assessed and that adequate
precautions are taken to minimize and mitigate risk.
5.25
Reasonable steps should be taken to prevent harm (physical, psychological, social,
legal, political and/or spiritual), injury or loss of opportunity to participants, researchers and the
environment. If harm, injury or loss of opportunity should occur, it should be dealt with in accordance with
the relevant policy and/or legislative frameworks.
5.26
Demographic information such as race or gender should not be used in research to discriminate or cause
loss of social standing for participants.  If these variables are required, it must be aligned to the aim and
objectives of the research.
5.27
Careful consideration should be given by researchers and Research Ethics Working Groups regarding the
appropriateness of proposed financial or other inducements to research participants, whether children or
adults, parents or guardians of children, or community gatekeepers.
5.28
Reimbursement of expenses (e.g. transport costs, meals) or compensation for the time or effort expended or
any opportunity that may be lost is allowed, on condition that all participants are offered similar
reimbursement and that such reimbursement is only aimed at recompensing the participants.
