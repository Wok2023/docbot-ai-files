1.1
The purpose of a grievance policy and procedure is to provide employees with a mechanism to express
dissatisfaction with an aspect of the employment environment or raise a concern about a perceived
violation of rights.
1.2
Airing grievances may be done formally or informally, and the purpose of the grievance procedure is
not to supersede other methods that may exist for solving dissatisfaction: instead, it is aimed at
providing an additional avenue to solve a grievance at the lowest level possible and as soon as possible.
Grievance
A grievance is any feeling of discontent or of having been wronged which an
employee might have in respect of their work and/or their work situation and
which is brought to the attention of Management.
procedure
A grievance procedure is created to resolve employee grievances about work and
work-related matters. Such a procedure promotes harmonious labour relations by
making available a reasonable and fair means of settling grievances and preventing
disputes.  A grievance procedure is, therefore an additional mechanism for
promoting upward communication.
Institution
A reference to Institution is a reference to STADIO.
3.1
An employee or their representative shall not be victimised or subjected to discrimination when they
submit a grievance or assists a colleague in dealing with a grievance.
3.2
The resolution of grievances is vested with Human Resources.
3.3
Grievances must be resolved as soon as practicably possible to avoid the actual or perceived
dissatisfaction being aggravated.
3.4
Grievences will be kept confidential in nature, where practically possible, should the employee so wish.
3.5
The grievance procedure shall not be used by an employee to process a matter of employee
misconduct or employee discipline.
3.6
A grievance may not be submitted regarding a matter that is the subject of disciplinary proceedings.
3.7
Where a grievance and a matter of employee misconduct are submitted in respect of materially similar
conduct, the Institution shall act based on the chronology of the submissions.
3.8
An employee or his representative shall not incur a loss of remuneration regarding time spent at
meetings with the company representatives arranged for resolving a grievance, in terms of this
grievance procedure.
3.9
An aggrieved party shall lodge a grievance within five (5) working days of the occurrence which gave
rise to it, unless there are particular circumstances which justify a delay.
3.10
An employee who intends to pursue grievance proceedings shall have a right to consult with a co-
worker during working hours to obtain assistance in resolving the grievance provided that:
3.10.1
Prior consent has been obtained from the line manager of the co-worker who has been
approached; and
3.10.2
The regular business of the Institution is not disrupted; and
3.10.3
The consultation engagement is kept to a minimum.
3.11
Any person intending to represent a co-worker in a STADIO grievance hearing process must also
seek the approval of their line manager, and such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
3.12
The principles of this grievance procedure shall apply evenly to all employees.
4.1
Right to be represented:
An employee has the right to be represented by a co-worker.
4.2
Right to be heard:
The employee has the right to state their case.
4.3
Witnesses:
The employee has the right to call witnesses to substantiate their case. (The employer also has the
equal right to call witnesses to substantiate their case.)
4.4
Documentation:
Both the employee and the employer have the right to rely upon and present documentation to
substantiate their case.
4.5
Interpreter:
The employee has the right to request the services of an interpreter. This request must be submitted
to the relevant official in Human Resources seven (7) working days prior to the scheduled date of the
hearing.
The employee consults their line manager.
1.1.1
The employee shall first consult and convey their grievance orally to their line manager.
1.1.2
The line manager must, to the best of their ability:
(a)
listen to the employee's grievance in private;
(b)
encourage the employee to state their case frankly and honestly;
(c)
obtain all facts regarding the grievance and distinguish facts from opinions; and
(d)
permit the employee's designated representative to provide the necessary
assistance in an attempt to resolve the grievance.
1.1.3
The line manager shall make reasonable efforts to resolve the grievance as soon as possible
and, save in exceptional circumstances, no longer than five days after it was lodged, unless
otherwise agreed with the employee involved.
1.1.4
Should the line manager be unable to resolve the grievance through the informal
procedures (indicated above), the employee has the right to complete the formal Grievance
Form, setting out the reasons giving rise to the grievance and the solution desired.
1.1.5
The employee must hand the Grievance Form to their line manager who must:
endorse that the grievance has not been resolved,
attach the Minutes of the discussion/engagement to the Grievance Form, and
refer the grievance to the Department of Human Resources.
Any further facts or reasons for the failure to resolve the grievance shall be set out on the
grievance form by the line manager.
When an employee alleges that a grievance has arisen out of the act of such employee's line
manager, the grievance shall be referred to the subsequent higher authority.
The paragraphs contained in Section A above apply mutatis mutandis with amendment as necessary.
1.3
Intervention by Human Resources
1.3.1
Human Resources shall convene a meeting/inquiry within 15 working days unless otherwise
agreed with the employee.
1.3.2
The employee and their representative and any witnesses who may assist in resolving the
grievance may attend the grievance hearing scheduled by Human Resources.
1.3.3
Human Resources shall appoint a member of Management or an independent Chairperson
to chair the grievance hearing, depending on the nature of the grievance and the seniority
of the parties involved.
If the grievance affects a group of employees, the following procedure will apply:
2.1
The employees will appoint a spokesperson to act on their behalf.
2.2
The spokesperson and not more than three employees will report the grievance to the relevant line
manager who will make every effort to resolve the grievance. When the employees allege that a
grievance has arisen out of the act of such employee's line manager, the grievance shall be referred
to the subsequent higher authority.
2.3
Should the supervisor be unable to resolve the grievance, then the procedure of 1.1.4  1.3.3 shall
apply.
2.4
Subject to paragraph 3.9 above, employees shall not stop work to lodge a grievance or to arrange and
participate in labour unrest. In this regard, the conditions stipulated in the Labour Relations Act, 1995
(Act No. 66 of 1995) regarding protected industrial action will apply
Effective management of a grievance requires a dedicated commitment to resolving the grievance as
soon as practicably possible.
Employee confidence in the grievance procedures must be promoted through line management
training to use the procedure properly in the spirit of an open and planned problem-solving approach.
The Grievance procedure is separate from disciplinary procedures indicated in the Employee
Misconduct Management Policy, but it may reasonably arise that disciplinary action is pursued by the
Institution as a result of a decision of the Grievance procedure.
